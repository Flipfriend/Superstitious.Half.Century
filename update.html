                <h1>UPDATE</h1>
                <p>Believe it or not we are ONE MONTH from the celebration date. Who would have ever guessed back in January when the
                original link was sent out that we would be experiencing what we have over the last six months?!! Not me.<br>We also thought this would be a good time for an update.</p>
                <h2>THE PARTY</h2>
                <p>We have decided to move forward and take our chances. It is an extremely tough call and the most important thing is the
                SAFETY OF OUR GUESTS. With that in mind please, please, please make the decision regarding attending that YOU are
                comfortable with. If you are not there physically we will know you are there spiritually. Only you can decide what you
                are comfortable with and we will support that decision.</p>
                <h2>PRECAUTIONS</h2>
                <p>We recognize the time we are in and we believe without any doubt that COVID-19 is real. To hold any kind of event we
                firmly believe that as hosts we have a tremendous responsibility to ensure that we have done everything we can to
                minimize risk and the possible spread of this virus. Here are a few things we are doing and/or suggesting:</p>
                <li>We are limiting the attendance to 50 or less people; the venue holds several hundred and we feel this allows for
                appropriate distancing</li>
