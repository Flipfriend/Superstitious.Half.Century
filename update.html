                    <h1>UPDATE</h1>
                    <p class="italics">Believe it or not we are ONE MONTH from the celebration date. Who would have ever guessed back in January when the
                    original link was sent out that we would be experiencing what we have over the last six months?!! Not me.<br><br>We also thought this would be a good time for an update.</p>
                    <h2 class="italics">THE PARTY</h2>
                    <p class="italics">We have decided to move forward and take our chances. It is an extremely tough call and the most important thing is the
                    SAFETY OF OUR GUESTS. With that in mind please, please, please make the decision regarding attending that YOU are
                    comfortable with. If you are not there physically we will know you are there spiritually. Only you can decide what you
                    are comfortable with and we will support that decision.</p>
                    <h2 class="italics">PRECAUTIONS</h2>
                    <p class="italics">We recognize the time we are in and we believe without any doubt that COVID-19 is real. To hold any kind of event we
                    firmly believe that as hosts we have a tremendous responsibility to ensure that we have done everything we can to
                    minimize risk and the possible spread of this virus. Here are a few things we are doing and/or suggesting:</p>
                    <li class="dent">We are limiting the attendance to 50 or less people; the venue holds several hundred and we feel this allows for
                    appropriate distancing</li>
                    <li class="dent">We will ask that everyone wear masks as appropriate (we will not be enforcing masks but will follow whatever the LA
                    County and/or venue guidance is at the time of the event). Currently the venue believes that mask wearing will be at our
                    own discretion as this is a private event. We realize that for some reason the wearing of masks has become a political
                    issue and just ask that we all set that aside and simply think of it as a way to respect the comfort level of both
                    attendees and staff.</li>
                    <li class="dent">Please DO NOT attend the event if you are showing any signs/symptoms of being sick (fever, cough, chills, continuous
                    headache or aches).</li>
                    <li class="dent">As an example we will be getting antibody testing 1-2 days prior to the event; please feel free to do the same</li>
                    <p class="italics">Thank you for indulging what are undoubtedly the strangest pre-party instructions you have ever received. But, we are
                    living in strange times.</p>
                    <h2>THE VENUE</h2>
                    <p class="italics">Saint Rocke continues to feel confident that we are allowed to host the event under the current Phase 3 opening
                    guidelines. They are taking some of their own precautions:</p>
                    <li class="dent">Each attendee will sign a waiver releasing Saint Rocke from responsibility if anyone were to contract COVID-19</li>
                    <li class="dent">Shared food/buffet style eating is not allowed; we are currently working with them to figure out how we can still offer
                    food from their kitchen in one-off orders</li>
                    <li class="dent">The bar areas will operate as normal but most likely social distancing measures while ordering will be in place (side
                    note that food and drink are included for attendees but you may feel free to tip staff at your discretion)</li>
                    <h2 class="italics">THE BAND</h2>
                    <p class="italics">The LA Session Group has pulled together 6 of LA’s finest musicians to comprise the band (links to bio’s coming). They
                    will be playing two sets (30 songs total) of some of my favorite songs over the last 50 years. Expect songs from The
                    Beatles, AC/DC, WEEN, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Bruno Mars, Maroon 5, Prince, Queen, Lenny Kravitz, My Morning
                    Jacket, ABBA, The Ramones, Van Halen, Red Hot Chili Peppers and more!! In fact, the next activity after the brackets
                    (thanks to all who participated!!!) is that you will all be voting on one song for each set AND for the encore! You get
                    to choose!! Please vote even if you are unable to attend—it’s your way of getting to be a part of celebration!<br><br>As an extra added bonus Tyler and Hannah will be doing a DJ set after the band finishes!!<br><br>We truly hope this event gets to happen and if it does it happens safely. We ALL play a part in making that happen.
                    Thanks and cheers!!<br><br>Chris and Kimm</p>
